📊 CRM Analytics – Customer & Sales Insights
📝 Project Overview

CRM Analytics focuses on analyzing customer lifecycle data to understand how leads convert into customers, how revenue is generated, and how customer retention impacts business growth.

In this project, I analyzed CRM data to uncover insights related to lead conversion, sales performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends, and presented them through structured analysis and dashboards.

🎯 Business Problem

Organizations often struggle to:

Track lead-to-customer conversion

Identify high-value customers

Understand sales performance across regions

Reduce customer churn and improve retention

This project addresses these challenges by using CRM data to generate actionable, KPI-driven insights for business decision-making.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset simulates a real-world CRM system and includes:

Leads data – lead source, status, conversion

Customer data – customer details and segments

Sales data – deals, revenue, stages, and regions

Data was cleaned and structured before analysis.
